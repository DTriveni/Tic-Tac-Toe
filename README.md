This project is a `Tic-Tac-Toe Game implemented in R`, where a human player competes against the computer. The game logic includes various functions to check for wins, blocks, and draws, ensuring a fair and competitive experience. Key features include:

**User & Computer Moves:** Users input their moves, and the computer uses strategic logic to play its turns.
**Winning Logic:** Functions (compwin and userwin) check if either player has won by aligning three symbols in a row, column, or diagonal.
**Blocking & Strategy:** The computer blocks potential winning moves by the player and applies a strategy to maximize its chances of winning.
**Draw Condition:** If all positions are filled and no player has won, the game is declared a draw.
**Interactive Play:** The game prompts users for valid inputs and updates the board dynamically after each move.

This project demonstrates the implementation of decision-making algorithms and user interaction in a classic `Tic-Tac-Toe Game`.
